Guidance for practitioners who are trying to build their own models. We know how hard it is to decifier source system data (typically from BMS) that has been randomly labeled.

Information on analytics functions that can be run against well built (validated) models. While the validation in the section above is based partly on this content, in this section we break down the rules available; describing how they function, any concessions or variations made, the requirements to enable them, when you should deploy them, and why they are important.

### 3. Graphs
This section is a technical insight into some of the queries, attributes, and tooling around graph models. We explore:
